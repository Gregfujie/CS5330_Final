Project Description(Copied from email check-in): I'm writing on behalf of our group to provide a check-in update for our CS5330 final project, titled “3D Scene Reconstruction with Semantic Filtering via Gaussian Splatting.” Our project aims to improve the quality of reconstructed 3D scenes from videos by first applying semantic segmentation and inpainting techniques to remove transient objects (such as people and vehicles), and then using Gaussian Splatting to produce cleaner, more accurate 3D reconstructions.
